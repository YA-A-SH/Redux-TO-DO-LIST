Redux Task Master ⚡ | CRUD State Management
A streamlined To-Do List application focused on mastering global state management using Redux Toolkit. This project demonstrates a significant leap in architectural clean-code and efficient UI rendering.

🎯 Project Focus
The primary goal of this project was to implement a robust Redux workflow. While design was kept minimal, the focus was on:

Simplifying complex state updates.

Enhancing code maintainability.

Mastering the Redux-MUI integration.

🛠 Tech Stack
React.js

Redux Toolkit (RTK): Managing tasks, completion toggles, and filtering.

Material UI (MUI): Advanced usage of Modals, Grids, and Floating Action Buttons (FAB).

LocalStorage Sync: State persistence via Redux subscription.

🚀 Technical Highlights
Performance Optimization: Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders in list items.

Clean Architecture: Separated logic into Slices, making the codebase scalable and easy to debug.

Enhanced UX: Implemented dynamic Modals and multi-color Alerts for different actions (Add/Edit/Delete).

ID Generation: Utilized crypto.randomUUID() for professional-grade unique identification.

💡 Developer's Reflection
"I was surprised by how much Redux simplifies the data flow. Compared to my first project, using MUI felt natural and significantly faster. This entire project was completed in less than 24 hours, marking a milestone in my speed and technical confidence."
